#What is it?
------------

This is my first project with Easy Code.
The project is a fully responsive landing-page.

#What tools was the project developed with?
-------------------------------------------

The project was developed with using:
* HTML5;
* CSS3;
* jQuery and jQuery UI;
* Google Map API.

The grid is similar to the bootstrap grid. Adaptability was ensured without
direct Bootstrap framework use.

#What does landing consist of?
------------------------------ 

Landing consists of 9 main blocks (sections):
1. Header
2. About
3. Services
3. Portfolio
4. Advantages
5. Slider with customer reviews
6. Latest news
7. Two contact forms
8. Google Map
9. Footer.

Header contains logo and main navigation menu.
Sections "Portfolio" and "Services" were developed with using tabs.
Customer reviews section looks like slider, developed with Owl Carousel jQuery plugin.
Due to contact forms users can subscribe on the latest news and send messages.
Footer contains the most popular social icons-links.
